# Probabilistic Generative Models

This repository contains implementations of several probabilistic generative models using PyTorch. The models were implemented from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of their inner workings.

## Models Implemented

The following models have been implemented in this project:

1. Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
2. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
3. Real-NVP Normalizing Flows

## Language and Tools

The project was implemented using Python, with the following libraries:

- PyTorch: Used for creating and training the models.
- NumPy: Used for numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: Used for creating plots to visualize the results.

## Documentation

Each model implemented in this project is accompanied by a detailed report in PDF format. These reports provide a comprehensive explanation of the model architecture, the implementation details, and the results obtained. You can find these reports in the same directory as the corresponding model file.

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine and run the Python scripts for each model.

## Future Work

Future updates will include more models and possibly improvements to the current implementations. Contributions are welcome!
